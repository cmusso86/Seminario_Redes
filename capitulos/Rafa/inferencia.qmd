-   Given a patient who returned from Africa with a fever and body aches, the most likely AI's explanation was malaria

## Inteligent Machines and Causal Reasoning

::: {.nonincremental}
- Instead of the mere ability to correlate fever and malaria, machines [need the capacity to reason that malaria causes fever]{style="color:red"}. 
- Then, it becomes possible for machines to ask counterfactual questions 
  - How the causal relationships would change given some kind of intervention?
- Pearl views it as the cornerstone of scientific thought.

## Causal Inference 


::: {.incremental}
- Mathematics has not developed the asymmetric language required to capture our understanding that if $X$ causes $Y$ that [does not mean]{style="color:red"} that $Y$ causes $X$^["It sounds like a terrible thing to say against science, I know. If I were to say it to my mother, she‚Äôd slap me."]
- Pearl proposes a formal language in which to make this kind of thinking possible 
- The main change is the possibility to evaluate $P(Y = y|do(X = x))$

## Pearl's Criticism on Deep Learning 


::: {.nonincremental}
- He did not expect that so many problems could be solved by [pure curve fitting]{style="color:red"}.^["If you deprive the robot of your intuition about cause and effect, you‚Äôre never going to communicate meaningfully. Robots could not say 'I should have done better'."] 
- But what next?
    - "Can you have a [robot scientist]{style="color:Violet"} that would plan an experiment and find new answers to pending scientific questions? That‚Äôs the next step."

## Counterfactual example

A counterfactual explanation of a prediction describes the [smallest change to the feature]{style="color:MediumSeaGreen"} values that changes the prediction to a [predefined output]{style="color:red"}.

## Explaining DNN (CNN) by causal interventions

::: {.nonincremental}
- The ability to perform arbitrary [causal interventions]{style="color:Violet"} allows [...] to seamlessly capture the chain of causal effects from the input, to the filters, to the DNN outputs
- ‚ÄúWhat is the [impact]{style="color:Violet"} of the *n-th* filter on the *m-th* layer on the model‚Äôs predictions?‚Äù
- Using the Structural Causal Models the model‚Äôs performance post compression could be predicted [without the need for retraining]{style="color:red"}.

## Deep causal learning {.my-mid-slide}


The three core strengths of deep learning for casual learning are:

::: {.nonincremental}
1. Causal explanations beyond RCTs;
2. Strong representational and learning capabilities; and
3. The ability to [approximate data generation mechanisms]{style="color:Violet"}.

3. [Effective combination]{style="color:Violet"} of the DNN and causal inference theory by evaluating propensity scores^["Popensity score methods are used for removing the effects of confounding when estimating the effects of treatment on outcomes".

::: {.nonincremental}
- [Shedding light into black-box]{style="color:MediumSeaGreen"} DNN models by calculating propensity scores and estimating treatment effects
- Identifying [causal relationships]{style="color:MediumSeaGreen"} between supplier characteristics and the expected delivery performance

## Examples of conclusions

::: {.nonincremental}
- [Country]{style="color:MediumSeaGreen"}: comparing suppliers based on their origin, the strong performance of foreign suppliers is apparent. Overall, deliveries by domestic suppliers are affected by an average reliability [decrease of 39.7%]{style="color:red"}.
- [Product Group]{style="color:MediumSeaGreen"}: raw material suppliers show a superior delivery performance ([increase of 55.2%]{style="color:red"}) in comparison to vendors offering operating supplies, measurement equipment, and spare parts.
