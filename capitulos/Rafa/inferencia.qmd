# Inferência Causal

## Motivation

::: {style="text-align: center; margin-top: 1.75em; font-size: 1.2em"}
::: incremental
-   Given a patient who returned from Africa with a fever and body aches, the most likely explanation was [malaria{style="color:green"}]
-   But AI got mired in probabilistic associations
-   The key, [Judea Pearl] argues, is to replace reasoning by association with causal reasoning

## Inteligent Machines and Causal Reasoning

::: {.nonincremental}
- Instead of the mere ability to correlate fever and malaria, machines [need the capacity to reason that malaria causes fever]{style="color:red"}. 
- Then, it becomes possible for machines to ask counterfactual questions 
  - to inquire how the causal relationships would change given some kind of intervention
- Pearl views as the cornerstone of scientific thought.

## Causal Inference 


::: {.nonincremental}
- Pearl also proposes a formal language in which to make this kind of thinking possible 
- According him, it is a 21st-century version of the Bayesian framework that allowed machines to think probabilistically.
